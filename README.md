## Overview

![overview]()
>In this paper, we propose a novel camera-aware Jaccard (CA-Jaccard) distance that leverages camera information to enhance the reliability of Jaccard distance. 
Specifically, we introduce camera-aware k-reciprocal nearest neighbors (CKRNNs) to find k-reciprocal nearest neighbors on the intra-camera and inter-camera ranking lists, which improves the reliability of relevant neighbors and guarantees the contribution of inter-camera samples in the overlap. Moreover, we propose a camera-aware local query expansion (CLQE) to exploit camera variation as a strong constraint to mine reliable samples in relevant neighbors and assign these samples higher weights in overlap to further improve the reliability. Our CA-Jaccard distance is simple yet effective and can serve as a general distance metric for person re-ID methods with high reliability and low computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yoonkicho/PPLR
cd CA-Jaccard
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Preparing Datasets

```shell
mkdir data
```

Download the datasets Market-1501, MSMT17, and VeRi-776 to `CA-Jaccard/data`.
The directory should look like:

```
CA-Jaccard/data
â”œâ”€â”€ market1501
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Market-1501-v15.09.15
â”œâ”€â”€ msmt17
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MSMT17_V1
â””â”€â”€ veri
    â””â”€â”€ VeRi776
```

## Training

We utilize 4 RTX 3090 GPUs for training.
We use 256x128 sized images for Market-1501 and MSMT17 and 224x224 sized images for VeRi-776.

For Market-1501:

```

```

For MSMT17:

```

## Testing 

We use a single RTX 3090 GPU for testing.
